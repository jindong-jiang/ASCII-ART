# ASCII-ART
Play the video with the text of ASCII charater. A video palying the charater,programmed with Python and VIM in linux,as a gift for my friend, hope my friend Tamako can have fantastic birthday!!!
The idea here is to pull out every frame of the video, and transfer the picture of the frame to ASCII style by placing the ASCII charaters according to the value of the image point, and then make them emsamble,get a huge txt file, here I use a vim script to drive the runing of page.
If you want to see the video, don't hesitate to visit my youtube, you are more than welcome!!!
