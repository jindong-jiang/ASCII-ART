# ASCII-ART
Using the charater to creat the art
The idea here is to pull out every frame of the video, and transfer the picture of the frame to ASCII style by placing the ASCII charaters according to the value of the image point, and then make them emsamble,get a huge txt file, here I using a vim script to drive the runing of page.
